# SpeedrunLuckSimulator
This tool was built to model the behaviours of Minecraft Speedrunners in respect to the collection of blaze rods through farming and ender-pearls through piglin bartering.

The tool was initially built following the controversy around Dream's 1.16 speedrun, and models how changing the goals of the player can significantly improve their chances of recieving the loot required to complete a speedrun.

I initially didn't intend for this program to be published, so I coded the whole thing in c++ in CodeBlocks. Unless you have CodeBlocks installed, I have no clue if you'd be able to view this software on your device.
